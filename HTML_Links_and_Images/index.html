    <!-- To create a link, use the <a> tag: -->
    <!-- href contains the actual link, the tag will take you to -->
    <!-- set target to _blank, if you want the link to open in a new tab -->
    <!-- The noopener value prevents the opened link from gaining access to the webpage from which it was opened.

    The noreferrer value prevents the opened link from knowing which webpage or resource has a link (or ‘reference’) to it. 
    The noreferrer value also includes the noopener behaviour and thus can be used by itself as well
    This is done for security reasons such as phishing attacks -->
